### Hi there 👋

**tsof-smoky/tsof-smoky** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently a student in FPTHCM
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Information Assurance
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Cyber, something new, blaaa
- ⚡ Fun fact: Anime, sports, car, bruhhhh

Good luck and have fun!
